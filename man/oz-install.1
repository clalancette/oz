.SH NAME
oz-install - tool to automatically install operating systems into files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oz-install [OPTIONS] <tdl-file>

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a tool to automatically install operating system into files
that represent disk images.  The input is an XML file representing the
operating system and packages to be installed.  By default (and by
design), the first stage of the install only installs a JEOS (Just
Enough Operating System); customization, including the installation of
additional packages can also be done, but requires additional flags.

Note that oz-install does the actual installation using a combination
of KVM and libvirt, so both of these must be available (and working)
for oz-install to have a chance to succeed.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-a <auto>"
Use the user-provided auto installation file \fBauto\fR.  By default, Oz
will use a hard-coded auto-installation file (kickstart, preseed, sif,
etc) to do a basic OS installation.  Using this option, the user can
provide an alternate auto-installation file to do the install.  The
caveat is that user-provided auto-installation files are more likely
to cause installation errors, so this option should be used with caution.
.TP
.B "\-b <disk_bus>"
Use \fBdisk_bus\fR for the storage device while doing the install.
By default, Oz has built-in knowledge of the appropriate disk bus to
use while installing each guest operating system (ide or virtio).
This option allows the user to override that default with their own
choice.
.TP
.B "\-c <config>"
Get the configuration from config file \fBconfig\fR, instead of the
default /etc/oz/oz.cfg.  If neither one exists, Oz will use sensible
defaults.  The config file is in standard ini format; for an
explanation of the sections and keys, see the
.B CONFIGURATION FILE
section.
.TP
.B "\-d <loglevel>"
Turn on debugging output to level \fBloglevel\fR.  The log levels are:
.RS 7
.IP "0 - errors only (this is the default)"
.IP "1 - errors and warnings"
.IP "2 - errors, warnings, and information"
.IP "3 - all messages"
.IP "4 - all messages, prepended with the level and classname"
.RE
.TP
.B "\-f"
Force the generation of new installation media.  By default, oz-install will
always try to use a locally cached version of the oz-modified install
media if it is available.  Failing that, oz-install will try to use a
locally cached version of the pristine install media if it is
available.  You can use this flag to force it to always download and
regenerate the oz-modified install media, even if it has a local
version available.
.TP
.B "\-g"
Generate the ICICLE (a package manifest, with some additional metadata)
after the installation is complete.
.TP
.B "\-h"
Print a short help message.
.TP
.B "\-i <icicle>"
If oz-install has been instructed to generate an ICICLE (see the \-g
option), then it will normally write the ICICLE XML to stdout.  To
have oz-install write the ICICLE to a file instead, use the \-i
option.  Note that it is an error to specify \-i without \-g.
.TP
.B "\-m <mac_address>"
Use \fBmac_address\fR for the network device while doing the install.
The default value is autogenerated by Oz. This option allows the user
to override this behaviour.
.TP
.B "\-n <network_device>"
Use \fBnetwork_device\fR for the network device while doing the install.
By default, Oz has built-in knowledge of the appropriate network
device to use while installing each guest operating system (ne2k_pci,
rtl8139, virtio).  This option allows the user to override that
default with their own choice.
.TP
.B "\-p"
Cleanup old guests before installation.  By default, if a guest with
the same libvirt UUID, libvirt name, or diskimage exists prior to Oz
starting installation, Oz will abort.  If this option is used, then Oz
will undefine the libvirt guest with the same name or UUID and delete
the diskimage, so it should be used with caution.
.TP
.B "\-s <disk>"
Write the disk image to \fBdisk\fR, rather than the default of the
TDL name.
.TP
.B "\-t <timeout>"
Terminate the installation of the guest in \fBtimeout\fR seconds
rather than the oz default.  This value should be increased if running
on slow storage or running multiple oz-install operations on the same
machine.

Please note that there is a separate termination action that occurs if
300 seconds elapses with no disk activity to the operating system.
This timer value is not configurable.
.TP
.B "\-u"
Customize the image after installation.  This generally installs
additional packages onto the disk image after installation.
.TP
.B "\-x <xmlfile>"
Oz will normally generate a libvirt XML file in the current working
directory suffixed with the date and time.  Specifying the \-x option
allows the filename to be overridden.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The Oz configuration file is in standard INI format with several
sections.  If any section or configuration key is missing, Oz will use
a sensible default.  For true/false configuration keys, the values of
"true", "True", "yes", or "Yes" can be used to turn the option on, and
"false", "False", "no", or "No" can be used to turn the behavior off.
The configuration file should have the following form:

.sp
.in +4n
.nf
[paths]
output_dir = /var/lib/libvirt/images
data_dir = /var/lib/oz
screenshot_dir = .

[libvirt]
uri = qemu:///system
type = kvm
bridge_name = virbr0
cpus = 1
memory = 1024
image_type = raw

[cache]
original_media = yes
modified_media = no
jeos = no
.fi
.in

The \fBpaths\fR section defines the paths that Oz will use for storing data.
The \fBoutput_dir\fR key describes where to store the images after they are
built, and the \fBdata_dir\fR key describes where to cache install media and
use temporary storage.  Both locations must have a decent amount of
free disk space in order for Oz to work properly.
The \fBscreenshot_dir\fR key describes where to store screenshots of
failed installs.

The \fBlibvirt\fR section allows some manipulation of how Oz uses libvirt.
The \fBuri\fR key describes the libvirt URI to use to do the guest
installation.  The \fBtype\fR key defines what type of virtualization
to use.  The \fBbridge_name\fR key defines which bridge Oz should
place the guests that it launches on.  The \fBcpus\fR key defines how
many cpus should be used inside the virtual machine.  The \fBmemory\fR
key defines how much memory (in megabytes) should be used inside the
virtual machine.  The \fBimage_type\fR key defines which output disk
type should be used; this can be any value that libvirt supports.

The \fBcache\fR section allows some manipulation of how Oz caches
data.  The caching of data in Oz is a tradeoff between installation
time and storage space.  The \fBoriginal_media\fR key tells Oz
to cache the original installation media so that it does not have to
download it the next time an install for the same operating system is
requested.  The \fBmodified_media\fR key tells Oz to cache the
oz-modified installation media so that it does not have to download
and modify it the next time an install for the same operating system
is requested.  The \fBjeos\fR key tells Oz to cache the installed
operating system after installation.  This can significantly speed up
subsequent installation of the same operating system, with the
additional downside of the operating system getting out-of-date with
respect to security updates.  Use with care.
