1.  More OS support:
     - Ubuntu 5.04, 5.10, 6.06, 10.04, and 10.10
     - Debian Etch, Lenny, Squeeze
     - SUSE Linux 10.0, 10.1
     - openSUSE 10.2, 10.3, 11.0 (autoyast)
     - OpenBSD (http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~brendan/howtos/openbsd_install/)
     - NetBSD (anita)
     - FreeBSD
     - Dragonfly BSD
     - Windows Vista, 2008, 7, 98, 95, ME
     - RHL 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2 (only nfs installs work)
2.  Add partition/disk size support to the TDL.
3.  Add improved error logging to guest installation.  That is, if the guest
installation fails, we want to get detailed error information out of the
installer to find out why.  Fedora/RHEL support doing remote syslog via
network or virtio-serial, and I also believe anaconda will dump data to syslog
during installation, so that is one avenue to pursue.
4.  Instead of calling out to an external 'gvnccapture' command to collect
a screenshot, we should instead write the thing in python using the gtk-vnc
library.  Unfortunately I have not figured out how to do it in python yet,
so this needs further research.
5.  If two of the same OSes are being installed at the same time on the same
machine, they will trample all over each other.  We need to handle this
situation.
6.  We should have our own exception class, rather than just raising "Exception"
all of the time.
7.  It should be possible to replace the subprocess call to fuseiso by
implementing our own fuse-python subclass.  Though this is probably a bit of
work.  Or we could possibly use libguestfs; it is unclear.
8.  Before attempting an install, check the data_dir and output_dir to make
sure that they will approximately have enough space for the install media
and the output disk image, respectively.
9.  Include the example TDLs in the RPM spec file.
10. Manpages for oz-install, oz-generate-cdl, oz-customize.
11. More flexible ISO installs - a local file should work just fine when we
are doing ISO installs (but not URL installs).
12. Relax-NG schema for TDL/CDL.
13. Documentation on how to use the classes, and what new classes need to
provide.
14. Add the ability to do (optional) checksumming on the downloaded install
media.
15. With windows from MSDN (at least 2000, maybe other versions too), the
top-level doesn't really contain the bits you care about.  What happens is
that there are 3 boot options on the CD: installer for Professional, Server, and
Advanced Server.  The directory structure on the CD is something like:

    english
        win2000
            adv_server
            pro
            server

and underneath each of (adv_server, pro, server) are the bits you care about.
To automate this you really need to figure out which one the user cares about,
then copy just that subdirectory.  You'll also need to extract the appropriate
parts of eltorito so it boots automatically, and then you'll also need to set
i386/txtsetup.sif [SetupData]: SetupSourcePath = "\".  See
http://old.bink.nu/bootcd/
16. Write a boxgrinder plugin.  This requires implementing a ruby class
for it, and implementing .after_init, .deliverables_exists?, .run, .deliverables.
17. RHEL-3 U1 and U2 fail to install.  This is probably due to a bug in anaconda
that prevents "method=" on the command-line to work, though I have not confirmed
that.
18. FedoraCore 1, 2, and 3 x86_64, fail to boot for some reason.
19. FedoraCore 6 x86_64 takes *much* longer to install than we give it time for.
20. RHEL-3 GOLD x86_64 fails to boot.
21. RHEL-4 GOLD, U1, U2 x86_64 crashes during install.
